/**
 * @zm-api-command-network-edition
 * @zm-api-command-auth-required true
 * @zm-api-command-admin-auth-required true
 * @zm-api-command-description Queries the status of the most recent HSM session.  Status information for a given HSM
 * session is available until the next time HSM runs or until the server is restarted.
 * <br />
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li> If an HSM session is running, "endDate" is not specified in the response.
 * <li> As an HSM session runs, numMoved and numMailboxes increase with subsequent requests.
 * <li> A response sent while HSM is aborting returns aborted="0" and aborting="1".
 * <li> If HSM completed successfully, numMailboxes == totalMailboxes.
 * <li> If &lt;GetHsmStatusRequest> is sent after a server restart but before an HSM session, the response will contain
 *      running="0" and no additional information.
 * <li> Once HSM completes, the same &lt;GetHsmStatusResponse> will be returned until another HSM session or a server
 *      restart.
 * </ul>
