ant "test" target
=================
These tests do not require Zimbra to be installed on the system under test.
Useful for exercising marshaling and unmarshaling for JAXB objects under src/java/

ant "wsdl-test" target
======================
These tests require Zimbra to be installed on the system under test with starndard test users in place.
They rely on Java API files automatically generated from WSDL files by the ant target "wsdl-client-support".
The main intention is to validate that correct, working WSDL client software can be written based on our WSDL.
The JAXB classes under src/java/ are NOT typically tested directly by these tests, although to some extent
their correctness is being validated as the WSDL files are based on them and the test API is based on the WSDL.

zmsoap -z RunUnitTestsRequest
=============================
Where ZimbraServer has been updated to use the JAXB classes, some tests have been added to the
RunUnitTests framework.
e.g. see com.zimbra.qa.unittest.TestJaxbProvisioning whose source is under the ZimbraServer project.
