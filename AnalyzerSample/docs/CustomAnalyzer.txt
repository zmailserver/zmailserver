Steps for creating a custom plug-in analyzer:

1) Copy the code in this project to some other location: update the package references for the new location.
2) Change SampleAnalyzerExtension.getName() to return the name of your analyzer.  This name is some unique identifier
   for your analyzer: it must not be the same as any other analyzer in the system.
3) In SampleAnalyzer.java, modify the tokenStream() method to return an instance of your custom analyzer for any
   LuceneFields you want to custom analyze.
4) Compile your project.
5) Install your project's JAR file into /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/Name-Of-Your-Analyzer/Name-Of-Your-Analyzer.jar.  You will
   need to re-start your server.
6) Modify the zimbraTextAnalyzer Account or COS settings of the user or users to point to your new analyzer:
   $ zmprov ma user1@mydomain.com zimbraTextAnalyzer Name-Of-Your-Analyzer
7) New messages will be analyzed with the new plugin.  Search strings will be analyzed with the new plugin.
