               Cache Representation of Routing Lookup Information
               --------------------------------------------------

   NGINX caches the mail server routing information into memcached server(s). 
   The routing information comprises the IPv4 address of the upstream server,
   and the port number on which the relevant mail service (IMAP/POP3/SMTP) 
   can be reached. 

   The routing information is specific to a login name plus protocol. The 
   routing information itself contains the IPv4 address of the upstream server
   and the port number. 

   Hence, the cached representation for routing information is as follows:

   KEY := PROTOCOL:LOGIN
   VALUE := A1.A2.A3.A4:PORT
   PROTOCOL := [ IMAP | POP3 | SMTP ]
   A1 := OCTET1 (IPADDR)
   A2 := OCTET2 (IPADDR)
   A3 := OCTET3 (IPADDR)
   A4 := OCTET4 (IPADDR)

   where:

   . KEY is the key that is sent to the memcached server
        If john@doe.com logs in via IMAP, this will read "IMAP:john@doe.com"
        without the quotes.
   . VALUE is the corresponding value stored in memcached
   . IPADDR is the IPv4 address of the upstream mail server
   . PORT is the port number on the upstream server that runs the
     IMAP/POP3/SMTP service
