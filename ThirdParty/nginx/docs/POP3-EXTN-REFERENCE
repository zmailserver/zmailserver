POP3 Extension Mechanism

(last updated 2007-10-04)

The POP3 Extension Mechanism [RFC 2449] updates RFC 1939 to define a
mechanism to announce support for optional commands, extensions, and
unconditional server behavior.  Included is an initial set of
currently deployed capabilities which vary between server
implementations, and several new capabilities (SASL, RESP-CODES,
LOGIN-DELAY, PIPELINING, EXPIRE and IMPLEMENTATION).  The RFC also
extends POP3 error messages so that machine parsable codes can be
provided to the client.


POP3 capabilities

New POP3 capabilities MUST be defined in a standards track or IESG
approved experimental RFC, and MUST NOT begin with the letter "X".

New POP3 capabilities MUST include the following information:

CAPA tag
Arguments
Added commands
Standard commands affected
Announced states / possible differences
Commands valid in states
Specification reference

Initial Set of Capabilities

IMPLEMENTATION              [RFC2449]
AUTH-RESP-CODE              [RFC3206]


In addition, new limits for POP3 command and response lengths may
need to be included.

POP3 Response Codes

New POP3 response codes MUST be defined in an RFC or other
permanent and readily available reference, in sufficient detail so that
interoperability between independent implementations is possible.
(This is the "Specification Required" policy described in [IANA]).

New POP3 response code specifications MUST include the following
information: the complete response code, for which responses (+OK
or -ERR) and commands it is valid, and a definition of its meaning and
expected client behavior.

                                  PASS, or APOP.

* - see spec for details

Note: Returning the AUTH response code to the USER command reveals
to the client that the specified user exists.  It is strongly
RECOMMENDED that the server not issue this response code to the
USER command.
