          Instructions for running nginx-zimbra as an IMAP/POP3 proxy
          -----------------------------------------------------------

    This document describes how to set up nginx to act as an IMAP/POP3 proxy
    in front of a Zimbra Mail Server. This document assumes that nginx-zimbra
    has already been built and installed on your system at /opt/zimbra/nginx/
    and that memcached has been built and installed on your system at
    /opt/zimbra/memcached/

    See the BUILDING document for details on building nginx-zimbra and 
    memcached. 


                  (Section I) - Setup nginx configuration file
                  --------------------------------------------

    Make a local copy of the sample nginx configuration file
    //depot/main/ThirdParty/nginx/extras/sample.conf

    Open the local copy /path/to/nginx.conf in a text editor and adjust the
    configuration parameters to the required values.  The sample.conf file
    provides explanations for most of the relevant configuration directives,
    for the complete directive reference, please refer to the NGINX wiki at
    http://wiki.codemongers.com/

                 (Section II) - Configure the memcached servers
                 ----------------------------------------------

    nginx-zimbra can make use of one or more memcached servers to cache 
    upstream server information for clients logging in via imap/pop3/smtp

    Depending upon the expected number of clients logging in and the available
    system memory, start one or more instances of memcached on local or 
    remote servers. 

    Assuming that memcached is installed under /opt/zimbra/memcached on all 
    systems, you can start memcached on any system using the command:

        $ /opt/zimbra/memcached/bin/memcached -p 11211 -vv

    The -vv switch causes memcached to be verbose, and the -p switch indicates
    the port on which memcached should accept connections (11211 in this case).
    By default, memcached accepts connections on all network interfaces.
    Use the -l switch to override this (-h for all the available options)

    For each memcached instance started as above, edit the nginx.conf, and
    add the URI describing the location of the memcached instance against 
    the `memcache_servers' directive:

    mail {
        ...
        memcache_servers    localhost:11211 localhost:11212
                            remote1:11211   remote2:11212   remote3:11213;
        ...
    }


           (Section III) - Configure the HTTP routing lookup handlers
           ----------------------------------------------------------

    nginx requires HTTP routing lookup handlers to determine the upstream 
    server information for a particular client login. Zimbra Server exposes
    an nginx routing handler on port 7072 (*on dev builds) at the URI:
    /service/extension/nginx-lookup

    If nginx is proxying for a single local zimbra server, enter the location of
    the zimbra routing handler against the `auth_http' directive in nginx.conf:

    mail {
        ...
        auth_http       localhost:7072/service/extension/nginx-lookup;
        ...
    }

    If nginx is proxying for more than one zimbra server, then enter the URLs
    for each HTTP routing handler as follows:

    mail {
        ...
        auth_http   zs1:7072/service/extension/nginx-lookup
                    zs2:7072/service/extension/nginx-lookup;
        ...
    }

    where zs1, zs2, etc. are the fqdn, canonical names, or IP addresses of the
    zimbra servers.

    It is not necessary to put one entry against `auth_http' for each zimbra
    server that nginx is proxying for. Any one of the entries will suffice, 
    but more than one entry will ensure that the HTTP routing lookup requests
    will be sent to each server in turn using round-robin, so that the load
    is shared between each handler.


        Section (IV) - (Optionally) configure NGINX for SSL/STARTTLS
        ------------------------------------------------------------

    If you want to enable STARTTLS support in nginx, you need a cert/key pair.
    You can either obtain one by getting a certificate request signed by a CA,
    or building your own cert/key pair using openssl:

    $ mkdir /path/to/certs/
    $ cd /path/to/certs/
    $ openssl genrsa -out nginx.key 2048
    $ openssl req -new -x509 -key nginx.key -out nginx.crt

    Then, make sure that nginx.conf is configured to support STARTTLS:

    mail {
        ...

        starttls                    on;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;
        ssl_certificate             /path/to/certs/nginx.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key         /path/to/certs/nginx.key;

        ...
    }


         Section (V) - Configure NGINX IMAP and NGINX POP3 Proxy Ports
         -------------------------------------------------------------

    We need to configure the ports on which NGINX will listen for IMAP and 
    POP3 connections. The following example uses port 1143 for IMAP and port
    1110 for POP3:

    mail {

        ...

        server {
            listen     1110;
            protocol   pop3;
            proxy      on;
        }

        server {
            listen     1143;
            protocol   imap;
            proxy      on;
        }

        ...

    }

              Section (VI) - Test the configuration and run NGINX
              ---------------------------------------------------

    Test the configuration file syntax:
        $ sudo /opt/zimbra/nginx/sbin/nginx -c /path/to/nginx.conf -t

    Correct syntax errors, if any, and start nginx:
        $ sudo /opt/zimbra/nginx/sbin/nginx -c /path/to/nginx.conf

    Watch out for errors in the error.log:
        $ sudo tail -f /opt/zimbra/nginx/logs/error.log

    Stop NGINX once you're done:
        $ sudo killall nginx

             Section (VII) - Connect to NGINX with an email client
             -----------------------------------------------------

    Now that nginx is set up to proxy your email, you can set up Outlook/
    Thunderbird/Evolution or any other email client to talk to the NGINX 
    server via POP3 or IMAP. Make sure that your server name and port number
    in the account settings refer to the NGINX server (in this example, 
    port 1110 for POP3 and 1143 for IMAP).

    Enter your login and password, select the appropriate authentication 
    mechanism, use STARTTLS if required, and now you should be able to access
    your email

                                      ***
