                     Instructions for building nginx-zmail
                     --------------------------------------

    [*]  Check out //depot/main/ThirdParty/nginx/
         $ cd /path/to/depot/main/ThirdParty/nginx/

    [*]  Configure, build and install nginx on your system

         <NNN> refers to the latest version of nginx against which 
         the development patch has been tested. See the `docs/SUPPORTED'
         document for details about the current revision

         $ cd nginx-<NNN>-zmail/
         $ ./configure \
             --prefix=/opt/zmail/nginx/ \
             --with-debug \
             --without-http  \
             --with-mail \
             --with-mail_ssl_module
         $ make
         $ sudo make install

         This will install nginx onto your system under the directory
         /opt/zmail/nginx/

         Alternatively, nginx can be configured with
            --prefix=/opt/zmail/nginx-<NNN>/

         and the symlink
         /opt/zmail/nginx/ -> /opt/zmail/nginx-<NNN>/
         
         can be created

    [*]  Download the latest version of memcached
         (or use the one in //depot/main/ThirdParty/memcached/)

    [*]  Instructions to build memcached are in
         //depot/main/ThirdParty/memcached/README
