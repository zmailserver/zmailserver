CALENDAR Server-Side TODO list
-----------------------------------------

-- Support for "move to trash" instead of just deleting events for WEB client

-- VFREEBUSY for outlook

-- Alarm System / Alerts

-- need to update to new iCal4j APIs (stop using deprecated functions)
   -- blocked on iCal4j multi-threading fixes from Ben Fortuna (iCal4j maintainer)

-- need to support client-defined timezones for advanced clients

-- GetApptSummaries API should return DateTime, not GMT time, allow for timezone shifts

-- integrate with Indexing/Search

-- testing.  We need to come up with a more or less comprehensive set of tests.  There are a LOT of cases: self-created meeting, externally-created-meeting, accept, deny, add invitess, remove invitees, reply to meeting request forwarded from someone else, etc etc......maybe that's a good thing for me to be doing: I'll sit down and try to come up with a comprehensive list of test scenareos.

-- outlook integration testing (basic outlook func works, but not tested at all)
 
-- test with at least one other calendar program (apple iCal maybe?)

-- don't share same TzMap between all Invites in appointment: although it should mostly work, this is not strictly correct and could cause problems

 
 
 
Stuff to make us more-or-less compliant with RFC's (2445, 2446, 2447):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Method:COUNTER/DECLINECOUNTER (RFC2446: 4.2.4) -- for Propse New Time

-- Method:ADD
 
-- Method:REFRESH
 
-- iCalendar-based FREEBUSY requests
 
-- iCalendar-based DELEGATION (RFC2446: 4.2.5)
 
-- support for VTODOs and VJOURNAL


Longer-term stuff:
------------------
-- Two-Way sync of .ICS files (eg from Evolution)

TEST SCENAREOS:
---------------

**Note that this is just the list of operations -- there are many pieces
of state that can/should be checked between each op.  For example, in
the "basic" test you should check the AppointmentSummaries for each
user after each step: after step #1, there should an appointment
status of "Busy" for C1 and should be a tentative appointment for
C2...etc etc etc.  FreeBusy can be checked between calls, etc.


Basic test:
1) C1 Request Appt w/ C2 as attendee
2) C2 accepts

Basic test:
1) C1 Request all-day Appt w/ C2 as attendee
2) C2 accepts

Basic Modification:
1) C1 Requests
2) C1 Modifies appt start time
3) C2 accepts 2nd request

Basic Modification (2):
1) C1 Requests
2) C1 Modifies appt, changes name 
3) C2 accepts 2nd request

Basic Cancellation:
1) C1 Request Appt w/ C2 as attendee
2) C1 Cancels appointment

Modification, out of order accept:
1) C1 Requests
2) C1 Modifies appt, changes name 
3) C2 accepts request from (1), should give feedback that request is old
4) C2 accepts request from (2)

Cancellation, out of order accept:
1) C1 Requests
2) C1 cancels appt
3) C2 accepts request from (1), should give feedback that request is old

Modification, remove attendee
1) C1 Requests
2) C1 Modifies, removes C2 as attendee
3) C2 should receive cancellation notice

Modification of local copy
1) C1 Requests
2) C2 accepts
3) C2 modifies appointment, changing the name.  Should NOT give "must
   be organizer message" -- should modify local copy

Basic Recurrence:
1) Create a recurring appointment
2) Check to see that recurring appt is created

Basic Exception:
1) C1 Create a recurring appointment
2) C2 accepts
3) C1 modifies a specific instance of that appointment, changing the
   time
4) C2 should have invitation for change.  Old instance should be
   _removed_ from C2's calendar immediately, and the new time should
   appear as "tentative" on C2's calendar
5) C2 accepts

Cancel single instance
1) C1 Create a recurring appointment
2) C2 accepts
3) C1 cancels  a specific instance of that appointment
4) C2 should have invitation for change.  Old instance should be
   _removed_ from C2's calendar immediately, and the new time should
   appear as "tentative" on C2's calendar
