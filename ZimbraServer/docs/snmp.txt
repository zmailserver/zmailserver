Notes on snmp support.

	Traps only - there is no support for snmp queries, since there is no
	MIB for the product as yet.

Zimbra OID:
	Enterprise number for zimbra TBD.

MIB Objects:
	zmStatus := zimbra.1
	zmServiceName := zmStatus.0 (String)
	zmServiceStatus := zmStatus.1 (Int)
		0 for down, 1 for up.

Traps supported:
	zmtraps := zimbra.0
	zmServiceStatusTrap := zmtraps.0
		Includes an zmStatus object.

When snmp is configured to run, traps will be generated every 
time the status of a service changes.

Snmp configuration:
	- install the zimbra-snmp package.
	- run the createsnmp script, provide requested information (trap host)
	- start services (zmcontrol startup)
