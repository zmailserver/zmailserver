Greetings.

This is a sample message in the source code.  You can drop
other sample messages in this directory (ZimbraServer\data\TestMailRaw)
- during a "ant reset-the-world" these messages are 
inserted into the 'user1' mailbox.

The files here are nothing but straight RFC822 formatted
text.  In most mail clients, you can do a 'Show Original'
or equivalent function to see your message in its RFC822
form.

If you have any questions about the build, do not hesitate
to search for answers on our forums (http://www.zimbra.com/forums),
or to ask us a question of your own!
