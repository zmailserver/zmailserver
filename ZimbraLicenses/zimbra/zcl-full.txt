Open Source License Terms for the Zimbra Collaboration Suite

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SOFTWARE.
ZIMBRA, INC. ("ZIMBRA") WILL ONLY LICENSE THIS SOFTWARE TO YOU IF YOU
FIRST ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING
THE SOFTWARE, OR USING THE PRODUCT, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY
THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE PRODUCT.

   1. License and Terms. Zimbra's software contains software
      components that are licensed by Zimbra from various open source
      distributors and redistributed by Zimbra to you in accordance
      with the provisions of their open source licenses.

   2. Collective Work. In addition to the individual copyrighted works
      from third parties that comprise the Zimbra product, the product
      as a whole (called a "collective work" in copyright law) is
      itself a copyrighted work owned by Zimbra (the collective work
      is defined as the "Zimbra Product"). The Zimbra Product is
      licensed to you under the Zimbra Public License (which is based
      on the Mozilla Public License) but each component is licensed
      to you under separate terms which are described below.

         a. This page will link you to the licenses that apply to the
            individual components of the Zimbra Product which is
            considered Exhibit A to this Agreement and is included as
            part of the Agreement.

         b. We have reviewed the licenses of all components of the
            Zimbra Product. All components are sublicensed to you with
            permission of the copyright owner and under the terms of
            their original licenses.

   3. Redistribution. If your use of the Zimbra Product is entirely
      internal to your company, you need not worry about license
      conditions requiring the distribution of source code that could
      affect your own proprietary software. However, if you distribute
      modified versions of Zimbra Product outside of your company, you
      may, in certain circumstances, have a reciprocal obligation to
      disclose your modifications to Zimbra and others. These
      obligations are found in the licenses listed on Exhibit A.

   4. Patent Defense. Some open source licenses also contain
      reciprocal patent grants and patent defense provisions that
      extend to you as a sublicensee of the software. Such license
      provisions are designed to protect the customers and users of
      open source software - including companies like yours - from
      patent infringement lawsuits. In certain circumstances, however,
      if you own patents relating to Zimbra collective work or its
      components, these license provisions may subsequently limit your
      ability to sue Zimbra and its open source licensors for
      infringement of those related patents.

   5. Trademarks. Many open source components, and Zimbra software
      itself, are also protected by trademarks. While you are free to
      copy and distribute open source software, you are not allowed to
      market it under those trademarks without separate licenses.
      Zimbra is a trademark of Zimbra, Inc. The trademarks of the
      licensors of our components are listed on their separate
      websites.

   6. Support. The Zimbra Product is licensed without any
      support. However, Zimbra is a full-support company. Even though
      open source licenses for Zimbra components offer few if any
      warranties, Zimbra, itself, along with our open source partners,
      will support the components of the Zimbra Product. We encourage
      you to review our separate service and support offerings.
