A Short Guide on Zmail Desktop Development

The project folder for desktop specific stuff is under ZmailOffline.  The naming is historic as Zmail Desktop was initially called Zmail Offline.  To build and run dev version of desktop, you'll need at least the following projects:

Ajax
ThirdParty
ZmailCommon
ZmailIM
ZmailOffline
ZmailServer
ZmailTag
ZmailWebClient
Zimlet

To build, cd into ZmailOffline and run "ant offline-reset-the-world".  At the end of the build, the dev version of desktop will be deployed to /opt/zmail/zdesktop dev.  Note there's a space in the path, which is intentional.

The dev build can be started or stopped using a shell script called offline.  This script is copied to /opt/zmail/zdesktop dev/bin.

The dev build listens on port 7733, as opposed to 7633 used by the produciton build.  Therefore it's OK to run both installed production build and dev build on the same box.  The dev build doesn't come with prism, so use a browser to point to http://localhost:7733 to access the UI.

The best way to debug is to use jetty ant plugin.  There's a jetty-ant.xml file under ZmailOffline that is specific to running offline using jetty ant plugin.  See details on how to use jetty ant plugin in jetty.txt.
