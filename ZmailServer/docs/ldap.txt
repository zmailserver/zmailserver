ZimbraServer/build.xml now does most steps instructed here.

On windows make sure (a) you have installed OpenLDAP to
\opt\zimbra\openldap and (b) installed it as a service 
   C:\opt\zimbra\openldap> slapd.exe install

On unix make sure you have /opt/zimbra/bin/ldap {start|stop} script
handy.

Use the rest of this document as a reference for how to manually
handle an LDAP installation.

=======================================================================
Manual Instructions for Unix
======================================================================= 

We keep only the windows instructions here.  Unix instructions will
only be different in where you get binaries and where you stick conf
files (which is very different, but obvious).

=======================================================================
Manual Instructions for Windows
======================================================================= 

1. Run the OpenLDAP installer 

        \\KENNY\public\software\windows\openldap-2_2_15-1-win32.exe

   Make sure to set your install directory to C:\opt\zimbra\openldap

2. Copy ZimbraServer\conf\ldap\slapd.win.conf to C:\opt\zimbra\openldap\slapd.conf   [<== NOTE: RENAMING FILE]
   Copy ZimbraServer\conf\ldap\zimbra.schema  to C:\opt\zimbra\openldap\etc\schema\zimbra.schema

3. Start the slapd server from C:\opt\zimbra\openldap\slapd (use 
   "-d 10" to see debug output if you have problems).

   (If all goes well, nothing will seem to happen.  Empty window, no
   prompt.)

   If prompted, tell the XP firewall to allow OpenLDAP to do whatever
   it wants to do.

4. Run ldapmodify as shown below (slightly different from the Linux
   version because Windows dislikes quotes):

        cd <path-to-your-workspace>  (e.g. "cd C:\Workspace")
        C:\opt\zimbra\openldap\ldapmodify -a -c -w zimbra -D uid=zimbra,cn=accounts,cn=zimbra -x -f ZimbraServer/conf/ldap/zimbra.ldif

5. If you'd like, stop slapd and install it as a Windows service
   instead.
        C:\opt\zimbra\openldap\slapd install
        NET START "OpenLDAP Directory Service"
        
   Open the "Services" Control Panel (in the "Administrative Tools"
   section).

   Double-click on "OpenLDAP Directory Service" to bring up the
   "OpenLDAP Service Properties" dialog.

   Set the Startup type to "Automatic" and press the "Start" button
   (if needed).

6. Stop Tomcat.
   Run "reset-the-world" from Eclipse.
   Restart Tomcat.

7. Log out of the web front end.
   Log back into the web front end (password is now "test123").

8. Run the JXplorer installer
   \\KENNY\public\software\windows\JXv3.0_Windows_install.exe

9. To browse the LDAP directory:

   Start JXplorer.
   File -> Connect brings up the "Open LDAP/DSML Connection" dialog.
   Fill in the following values:
                Level: User + Password
                User DN: uid=zimbra,cn=accounts,cn=zimbra
                Password: zimbra
   Press the "Save" button.
   Press the "OK" button.
