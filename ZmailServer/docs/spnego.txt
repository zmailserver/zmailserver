I. SPNEGO SSO

   The SPNEGO SSO feature allows AD domain users to enter their Zmail mailbox without 
   having to re-authenticate themselves to Zmail by entering their Zmail credentials.
    
   Microsoft's Active Directory/Kerberos implementation is the single authentication store.
   
   It is essential that a user must logon to an AD domain, local logons will not work.
   
   Supported browsers and platforms:
   Windows:
     - Internet Explorer 6.0 or later
     - Firefox 3.0 or later
     - Chrome
     - Safari
     
   Mac:
     - Safari
   
   A high level description of the Authentication flow:
   (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995329.aspx for more information)
   
   - User logon to a Windows/AD domain.
   - The logged-on user must have acquired Kerberos credentials from the domain.
   - The logged-on user then attempts to access Zmail. 
   - Zmail is configured to redirect the request to a URL under SPNEGO protection. 
   - The Zmail server asks for authentication with Kerberos (by using SPNEGO). 
   - The client obtains a ticket for the requested service from the KDC and presents these credentials back to Zmail server.
   - The Zmail server extracts the user's credentials and authenticates the user.
   - The request is then redirected to the requested webapp with a Zmail auth token.
   - The webapp adapts the Zmail auth token and let the user in without requesting for hist Zmail login/password.

   Important notes:
       If you enable SPNEGO SSO on a domain, you must inform/instruct all users to configure 
       their browsers properly.  Improperly configured browser will behave differently depending 
       on the browser.  The fix is to properly configure the browser.
       
       This is also required for users loggon to the local domain and not intend to
       use SPNEGO SSO.
       
       This is because of the way SPNEGO challenge sequence works.  
       1. browser sends a vanilla request to ZCS

       2. since domain is configured to do SPNEGO, server will redirect the request to a
          SPNEGO protected area if the browser UA matches one of the supported browsers.  
          This vanilla request does not carry any indication whether the user is logged 
          on as local user or domain user.

       3. Server send a 401 to challenge for a SPNEGO token.

       4. Now, if browser is not properly configured, it will *not* respond to the challenge
          and will just give up there.  The user experience is a 401 HTTP error.

       If The browser is properly configured, it will respond to the challenge.  If the user is
       logged on as a local user, the SPNEGO token in the response will not be accepted by the server.
       At this point, server will redirect the request to the regular username/password 
       login page, and user can log in by entering their Zmail username/password.
       


II. Zmail UI Flow

Login:
1. user login to Windows or Mac as an AD domain user or a local user

2. user browses to the regular Zmail entry URL, e.g. http://dogfood.zmail.com

3. a domain(e.g. zmail.com) gets resolved by virtual host name (dogfood.zmail.com)

4. zmailWebClientLoginURL on domain redirects user to the spnego authentication 
   servlet.  The servlet is under spnego protection.  All requests must present a 
   valid spnego token when challenged.

5. spnego authentication happens, followed by the authorization process that 
   verifies the user indeed has an active account on the Zmail system.

6. if spnego auth succeeds, goto 7, if failed goto step 11.

7. user is redirected into the requested webapp.

Logout:
8. user clicks on the "logout" button, and gets redirected to the zmailWebClientLogOutURL 
   configured on the domain.

9. the logout URL points to the SSO logout page, which has a "Launch" button.  

10. user clicks on "Launch", and gets redirected to the regular Zmail entry page (goto step 2)
 
Error: 
11. (spnego authentication or Zmail authorization failed) user is redirected to the error URL, 
    which is defaulted to the regular username/password screen.

12. user can attempt to login by entering his Zmail username/password.


III. Configuration
======================================
1. Create and Set Up the Keytab File
======================================

On the Windows Server AD domain controller:

(A) Create an Active Directory service account.
    This is the account you use to generate the keytab.
       
    - programs -> Administrative Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers
    
    - right click on "Users" under the domain
    
    - new -> User 
    
    - Fill in the following:
          Full name: {a display name}

          User Logon Name: HTTP/{zmail-mailbox-server-name} (the domain is automatically filled)
          (Note: this is the value for the {zmail-mailbox-server-name} parameter in the setspn command (see below), and 
                 this is the value to be set for the zmailSpnegoAuthTargetName server attribute in LDAP.)

          User Logon Name (pre-Windows 2000): {Active Directory service account name} 
          (Note: this is the name you use for the -mapUser {AD-user} parameter in the setspn and ktpass commands (see below).)

      e.g.
          Full name: zmail-dogfood

          User Logon Name: HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com

          User Logon Name (pre-Windows 2000): zmail-dogfood 
      
    - click on Next

    - enter and confirm the password (e.g. test123)
      (Note: this is the password you use for the -pass {AD-user-password} parameter in the ktpass command (see below))
      
      check "password never expires"
      
    - click on "Next"
    
    - click on "Finish" to create the user.   


(B) Add the Service Principal Names (SPN) directory property for an Active Directory service account. 

    setspn -A {zmail-mailbox-server-name} {AD-user}
    
    e.g.
    - list registered SPNs (there is none)
      C:\>setspn -L zmail-dogfood
      Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=zmail-dogfood,CN=Users,DC=vmware,DC=com:

    - add SPN for the service account
      C:\>setspn -A HTTP/dogfood.zmail.org zmail-dogfood
      Registering ServicePrincipalNames for CN=zmail-dogfood,CN=Users,DC=vmware,DC=com HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com
      Updated object

    - list registered SPNs (should see the one we just added)
      C:\>setspn -L zmail-dogfood
      Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=zmail-dogfood,CN=Users,DC=vmware,DC=com:
      HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com


(C) Create the keytab file
   
    ktpass -out {keytab-file-to-produce} -princ {Service-Principal-Name}@{the-kerberos-realm} -mapUser {AD-user} -mapOp set -pass {AD-user-password} -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -pType KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
    
    e.g.
    The following will create jetty.keytab file under c:\Temp\spnego:
    
    C:\>ktpass -out c:\Temp\spnego\jetty.keytab -princ HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com@VMWARE.COM -mapUser zmail-dogfood -mapOp set -pass test123 -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -pType KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL
    Targeting domain controller: test-dc.vmware.com
    Using legacy password setting method
    Successfully mapped HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com to zmail-dogfood.
    Key created.
    Output keytab to c:\Temp\spnego\jetty.keytab:
    Keytab version: 0x502
    keysize 71 HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com@VMWARE.COM ptype 1 (KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL) vno3 etype 0x17 (RC4-HMAC) keylength 16 (0xc383f6a25f1e195d5aef495c980c2bfe)
    
    
(D) Place the Keytab File on Zmailserver   
    copy jetty.keytab created in step (C) to the zmail server (e.g. dogfood.zmail.com) as /opt/zmail/data/mailboxd/spnego/jetty.keytab

    Note: Do not rename the keytab file, the name(jetty.keytab) is referenced from various configuration files.

In a proxy - multi mailstore set-up, create a keytab file with proxy hostname as did on step (A) and copy it to all mailstores as did in step (D).

For a non proxy - multil mailstore set-up, Repeat steps (A) to (D) for each zmail server(e.g. catfood.zmail.com, corp.zmail.com).

=====================
2. Configure Zmail
=====================
- For production system, do 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.

- For dev system: do "ant spnego-dev-deploy" under ZmailServer.


2.1. Configure Global Config
----------------------------
We support only one REALM per Zmail installation.

Modify the following global config attributes with "zmprov mcf" command.

zmailSpnegoAuthEnabled     : TRUE
                              e.g. zmprov mcf zmailSpnegoAuthEnabled TRUE

zmailSpnegoAuthErrorURL    : URL to redirect users to on spnego auth failure.
                              If not set, the default is the requested webapp's 
                              regular login page.
                     
zmailSpnegoAuthRealm       : the kerberos realm in the domain controller
                              e.g. zmprov mcf zmailSpnegoAuthRealm VMWARE.COM


2.2. Configure Servers
----------------------
On each zmail server, modify the following global config attributes with "zmprov ms" command.

zmailSpnegoAuthTargetName  : the name for the service user in III. 1. (A), 
                              e.g. zmprov ms dogfood.zmail.org zmailSpnegoAuthTargetName HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com
                                   zmprov ms catfood.zmail.org zmailSpnegoAuthTargetName HTTP/catfood.zmail.com

zmailSpnegoAuthPrincipal   : {zmailSpnegoAuthTargetName}@{zmailSpnegoAuthRealm}
                              e.g. zmprov ms dogfood.zmail.org zmailSpnegoAuthPrincipal HTTP/dogfood.zmail.com@VMWARE.COM
                                   zmprov ms catfood.zmail.org zmailSpnegoAuthPrincipal HTTP/catfood.zmail.com@VMWARE.COM
  

2.3. Configure Domain
---------------------
(A) Setup kerberos Realm for the domain
    zmprov md {domain} zmailAuthKerberos5Realm {kerberos-realm}

    {kerberos-realm} should be the same realm set in global config attribute zmailSpnegoAuthRealm
    
    e.g. 
    zmprov md zmail.org zmailAuthKerberos5Realm VMWARE.COM
    
    Principal mapping:
    ------------------
    The SPNEGO token carries a user's kerberos principal.  After a user's SPNEGO token 
    is authenticated, ZCS servers need to identify the user in Zmail's LDAP.   
    A kerberos principal is mapped to a Zmail account by the following mechanism:
    
    Method 1. domain basis
         
              Requires the localpart of the kerberos principal be identical to the localpart 
              of one the user's Zmail email address (primary or alaises).
            
              A kerberos principal: 
                   {localpart-of-kerberos-principal}@{kerberos-realm}
              is mapped to Zmail account: 
                   {localpart-of-kerberos-principal}@{zmail-domain-with-zmailAuthKerberos5Realm-set-to-the-kerberos-realm}
              
              For example, 
              The setting: zmprov md zmail.org zmailAuthKerberos5Realm VMWARE.COM
              will map kerberos princiapl: user1@VMWARE.COM 
              to Zmail account: user1@zmail.com
              
              It is a config error if multiple domains have zmailAuthKerberos5Realm set to 
              the same realm.  In that case a MULTIPLE_ENTRIES_MATCHED exception will be thrown.
              
    or
    
    Method 2. account basis
              If method1 cannot fulfill all possible mappings, per-account basis mapping 
              is also supported.   This can map a Zmail user to any kerberos principal, it 
              also allows uzers in the same Zmail domain to be mapped to different kerberos 
              realms.
              
              Account level mapping is configured by setting zmailForeignPrincipal to 
              "kerberos5:{kerberos-principal}"
              
              For example, 
              zmrpov ma user1@zmail.org zmailForeignPrincipal kerberos5:foo@REALM1.COM
              zmrpov ma user2@zmail.org zmailForeignPrincipal kerberos5:bar@REALM2.COM
              
              It is a config error if multple accounts have he same zmailForeignPrincipal.
              In that case a MULTIPLE_ENTRIES_MATCHED exception will be thrown.
              
              
    Method 1 and 2 can co-exist.  The lookup will first try to find the account by 
    zmailForeignPrincipal (method 2).  If no account is found, it will fallback to use 
    domain based mapping (method 1).
    
    
(B) Setup virtual host for the domain
    zmprov md {domain} +zmailVirtualHostname {virtual-hostname-1} +zmailVirtualHostname {virtual-hostname-2} ...
    
    virtual-hostname-* are the hostnames you can browse to for the Zmail WEB UI.
    e.g.
    zmprov md zmail.com +zmailVirtualHostname dogfood.zmail.com +zmailVirtualHostname catfood.zmail.com
    
    
(C) Setup web client login URL and UAs/IP addresses allowed for the login URL on the domain
    - Set login URL.  Login URL is the URL to redirect to for logging in and when
      Zmail auth token is expired.  Set it to the spnego authentication servlet.
      zmprov md {domain} zmailWebClientLoginURL '/service/spnego'
    
    - Honor only supported platforms and browsers.  
      zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, all UAs are honored. If multiple values are set, an UA is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If UA is not honored, the request 
      will not be redirected to zmailWebClientLoginURL.
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-1} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-2} ...
      
      e.g. honor zmailWebClientLoginURL only for Firefox/IE/Chrome/Safari on Windows, and Safari on Mac)
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Firefox/3.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*MSIE.*Windows.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Chrome.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Safari.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedUA '.*Macintosh.*Safari.*'

    - Honor only seletced client IP addresses
      zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedIP is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, any client IP address is honored. If multiple values are set, an IP address is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If client IP is not honored, the request 
      will not be redirected to zmailWebClientLoginURL.
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLoginURLAllowedIP '10\.112\.205\.[1-9][0-9]'
      
      
(D) Setup web client logout URL and UAs allowed for the logout URL on the domain
    - Set logout URL.  Logout URL is the URL to redirect to when user clicks on "Logout".
      zmprov md {domain} zmailWebClientLogoutURL '../?sso=1'
    
    - Honor only supported platforms and browsers.  
      zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, all UAs are honored. If multiple values are set, an UA is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If UA is not honored, user will not be 
      redirected to zmailWebClientLogoutURL when logged out.
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-1} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA {UA-regex-2} ...
      
      e.g. honor zmailWebClientLogoutURL only for Firefox/IE/Chrome/Safari on Windows, and Safari on Mac)
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Firefox/3.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*MSIE.*Windows.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Chrome.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Windows.*Safari.*'
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedUA '.*Macintosh.*Safari.*'

    - Honor only seletced client IP addresses
      zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedIP is a multi-valued attribute, values are regex.
      If not set, any client IP address is honored. If multiple values are set, an IP address is honored  
      as long as it matches any one of the values.  If client IP is not honored, user will not be 
      redirected to zmailWebClientLogoutURL when logged out.
      zmprov md {domain} +zmailWebClientLogoutURLAllowedIP '10\.112\.205\.[1-9][0-9]'

3. Configure Your Browser
===========================
Windows
    Firefox:
        1. Browse to about:config and agree to the warnings
        2. Search through to find the "network" settings (in the Filter, type "network.n")
        3. Enter a comma-delimited list of trusted domains or URLs 
           for network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris and network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris.
           e.g.
             * set network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris to http://,https://
             * set network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris to http://,https://
             or
             * set network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris to http://dogfood.zmail.com,https://dogfood.zmail.com,http://catfood.zmail.com,https://catfood.zmail.com
             * set network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris to http://dogfood.zmail.com,https://dogfood.zmail.com,http://catfood.zmail.com,https://catfood.zmail.com
    
    IE/Chrome/Safari:
        1. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites
             * make sure everything is checked here
        2. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites -> Advanced
             * add url to server (http:// and/or https://) making sure to use the hostname
        3. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites -> Advanced -> Close
        4. Tools -> Options -> Security -> Local Intranet -> Sites -> Ok
        5. Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Security (in the checkbox list)
             * locate and check 'Enable Integrated Windows Authentication'
        6. Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Security -> Ok
        7. close IE

Mac
    Safari:
        Do not need any configuration.


================
4. Test it out
================
- On a Windows or Mac box, login to as a domain user.
  
  Your ticket as a domain user will be saved on the computer.
  Ths token will be picked up by the spnego aware browser and send in 
  the Authorization header to zmail server.
  
- Browse to the regualr ZWC entry page:
  e.g. http://dogfood.zmail.com
  
- You should be redirected to your inbox, without being prompted for Zmail username/password.

  
What happens behind the scene in ZCS server:
  - A domain gets resolved by the virtual host name setting.
    (zmailVirtualHostname on domain)
  
  - The request gets redirected to the login URL on the domain.
    (zmailWebClientLoginURL on domain)
  
  - spnego authentication and Zmail authorization happens
  
  - if authentication or authorization fails, user will be redirected to an error URL.
    (zmailSpnegoAuthErrorURL on global config)
    
  - if authentication and authorization succeeds, user will be redirected into the 
    requested webapp.
    

=====================
4. Trouble Shooting
=====================
(1) Make sure the following are true:
    - Intranet Zone
    - Accessing the server using a Hostname rather then IP
    - Integrated Windows Authentication in IE is enabled, the host is trusted in Firefox
    - The Server is not local to the browser
    - The client's Kerberos system is authenticated to a domain controller


(2) If the browser display the "401 Unauthorized", it's most likely that the browser either 
    did not send another request with Authorization in response to the 401, or had sent an 
    Authorization which is not using the GSS-API/SPNEGO scheme.  
    
    Check your browser settings, and make sure it is one of the supported browsers/platforms.  


(3) If you are redirected to the error URL specified in zmailSpnegoAuthErrorURL (or the login 
    page if zmailSpnegoAuthErrorURL is not set), that means authentication or authorization 
    failed.
     
    Take a network trace, make sure the browser send Authorization header(Appendix A: HTTP Flow, 5) 
    in response to the 401.  Make sure (use a network packet decodeder like Wireshark) the 
    Negotiate is using GSS-API/SPNEGO, not NTLM.
     
    After verifying that the browser is sending the correct Negotiate, if it still does not work, 
    turn on the following debug and check Zimrba logs:
     
    - ADD "-DDEBUG=true -Dsun.security.spnego.debug=all" (note, not replace) to 
      localconfig key spnego_java_options
   
    - add in log4j.properties:
      log4j.logger.org.mortbay.log=DEBUG 
      log4j.logger.zmail.account=DEBUG
    
    then restart mailbox server.
     
    Browse to the debug snoop page:  http://{server}:{port}/service/spnego/snoop.jsp     
    see if you can access the snoop.jsp
    
    Check zmmailboxd.out and mailox.log for debug output.
     
    * One of the error at this stage could be because of clock skew on the jetty server.  
      If this is the case, it should be shown in zmmailboxd.out.  Fix the clock skew and try again.


===========================================
5. Configure kerberos auth with SPNEGO auth
===========================================
Kerberos auth and SPNEGO can co-exists on a domain.   Use case is using kerberos as the 
mechanism for verifying user principal/password against a KDC, instead of the native 
Zmail LDAP, when user cannot get in by SPNEGO.

When SPNEGO auth fails, user is redirected to the Zmail login screen if browser is 
configured properly.   Users can enter their Zmail username/password on the login screen to 
login manually.  Domain attribute zmailAuthMech controls the mechanism for verifying  
password.   If zmailAuthMech is set to "kerberos5", user entered username is used to first 
identify a valid Zmail user (must be provisionined in Zmail LDAP), then from Zmail user 
is mapped to a kerberos principal, the kerberos principal + password is then validated 
against a KDC.   This KDC could be different from, or the same as the KDC that Active Directory 
domain controller(for SPNEGO auth) is running as.    

Note, Every Microsoft Active Directory domain controller acts as Kerberos KDC.  
For SPNEGO auth, KDC is not contacted from mailbox server.  The kerberos token sent from the 
Authorization http header along with jetty's keytab file can identify/authenticate the 
user.

For kerberos auth (zmailAuthMech="kerberos5"), mailbox server needs to contact KDC to 
validate principal+password.   For java kerberos client (i.e. Zmail mailbox server), 
the default realm and KDC for the realm is specify in a kerberos config file.  Location of 
this config file can be specified in JVM argument java.security.krb5.conf. If not specified,
default is /etc/krb5.conf.   When SPNEGO is enabled in Zmail, java.security.krb5.conf 
for mailbox server is set to "/opt/zmail/jetty/etc/krb5.ini".   Therefore, that is the 
effective file for configuring kerberos auth.

/opt/zmail/jetty/etc/krb5.ini is rewritten from /opt/zmail/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in 
each time when mailbox server restarts.  To configure, you need to modify the 
/opt/zmail/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in file, not /opt/zmail/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.

Under [realms] section, kdc and admin_server are not set for SPNEGO auth, but they are 
required for kerberos auth.   

To configure:

(1) Edit /opt/zmail/jetty/etc/krb5.ini.in

change:

[realms]
%%zmailSpnegoAuthRealm%% = {
                default_domain = %%zmailSpnegoAuthRealm%%
}

to:

%%zmailSpnegoAuthRealm%% = {
                kdc = YOUR-KDC
                admin_server = YOUR-ADMIN-SERVER
                default_domain = %%zmailSpnegoAuthRealm%%
}


replace YOUR-KDC and YOUR-ADMIN-SERVER to the hostname on which the 
kdc/admin_server for kerberos auth is running.

(2) save the file and restart mailbox server.


The restriction is, the realm for SPNEGO and kerberos auth must be the same.  
For SPNEGO auth, the kerberos principal in the Authorization header is mapped to a 
unique Zmail account.  For kerberos auth, the Zmail account is mapped to a unique kerberos 
principal.  The mapping (by domain attribute zmailAuthKerberos5Realm) is the same for both.
