The Cock Lane ghost attracted mass public attention in 18th-century England. 
In 1762 an apartment in Cock Lane, a short road adjacent to London's Smithfield 
market and a few minutes' walk from St Paul's Cathedral, was the site of 
a reported haunting centred around three people: William Kent, a usurer 
from Norfolk, Richard Parsons, a parish clerk, and Parsons' daughter 
Elizabeth.
