Wollstonecraft's philosophical and gothic novel revolves around the story 
of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband. It focuses on the
 societal rather than the individual "wrongs of woman" and criticizes what 
 Wollstonecraft viewed as the patriarchal institution of marriage in 
 eighteenth-century Britain and the legal system that protected it. 
 However, the heroine's inability to relinquish her romantic fantasies 
 also indicts women for wallowing in a false and damaging sentimentalism. 
 The novel pioneered the celebration of female sexuality and cross-class 
 identification between women. Such themes, coupled with the publication 
 of Godwin's scandalous Memoirs of Wollstonecraft's life, made the novel 
 unpopular at the time it was published.
