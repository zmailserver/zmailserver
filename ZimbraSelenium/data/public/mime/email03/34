	I wonder if I can construct something like this in a schema and
get XMLBeans to generate corresponding Java classes:

element "engine"
element "car" contains an "engine"
element "ford-engine" is an extension of "engine"
element "ford" is an restriction of "car" where the "engine" child element 
  must be an instance of "ford-engine"
the "ford*" elements are in a different namespace than the others

so this would be legitimate:

<a:car>
  <a:engine>
</a:car>

and this would be legitimate:

<b:ford>
  <b:ford-engine>
</b:ford>

but this would not:

<b:ford>
  <a:engine>
</b:ford>

	I'm not sure exactly how the "Ford" would be generated into a
JavaBean.  It would extend the "Car" bean.  Perhaps it would override the
"setEngine" method from "Car", but then have an assertion inside that that
"Engine" you passed in was really an "instanceof FordEngine".

	I've tried to construct this in XSD, but I'm stymied by the part
where "ford" restricts "car" to limit the type of engine passed in -- I
keep getting the following message, and it doesn't really give me enough
information to determine whether my syntax is wrong or the whole idea is
wrong or what.  Is this really supposed to be possible?

Thanks,
	Aaron
