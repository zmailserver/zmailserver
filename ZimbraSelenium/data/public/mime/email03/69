Hmmm,

Just on a  lark, I wondered if maybe my long file path to the code tree 
might be a problem, so I moved the code tree to the root directory of my 
drive and re-tried the build. Lo and Behold, the build worked just 
fine.  So then I dragged the exactsame directory back to its original 
location and retried the build. It failed with the same error as before. 
So I'm not sure why, but  my problem seemed to be related to the 
location of the tree. Possibly it's due to the very long path, possible 
it's due to spaces in the path?

Anyway, past my build problem. Woo Hoo!
