We originally had something like the following:

    class XmlLoader
    {
        static XmlObject parse ( File f ) { ... }
    }

The, to get a MyDocument, you would do:

    MyDocument myDoc =3D (MyDocument) XmlLoader.parse( ... );

If the XML to be parsed was not of the correct type (i.e. it did not have t=
he correct document element which made it a MyDocument), XmlLoader.parse wo=
uld still parse this XML, but it would not create a MyDocument, and the cas=
t above would fail and a ClassCastException would be thrown.  However, with=
 the current design:

    interface MyDocument implements XmlObject ...
    {
        static final class Factory
        {
            static MyDocument parse ( File f ) { ... }
        }
    }

One would say:

    MyDocument myDoc =3D MyDocument.Factory.parse( ... );

First, this is easier to read because there is no cast.  Also, because we g=
enerate a specific function to create MyDocuments, if the incoming XML does=
 not conform to the MyDocument schema, instead of getting a CLassCastExcept=
ion, we can perform a test and throw a nicer exception describing what was =
found and what was expected.

The reason we make a nested static class is because interfaces cannot have =
non virtual methods.

Also, because we interfaces and not a hierarchy of classes, an object hiera=
rchy approach will not work.

Hope this makes sense!

Ok, I did some searching in the archive and didn't see an answer to a
question I had on v1.  I've been looking at this software for the past 2
weeks for particular patterns used.  One question I have is - why was the
approach of using an internal final static factory inside of each xml type
interface used?  It certainly is clever but I am wondering why there was
not a typical object hierarchy strategy used?  I didn't think one could
override final members but I wrote test code mimicking this approach and
proved it to myself.  I assume because it is done inside of an interface
that it is not a problem.

Thanks,
jas
