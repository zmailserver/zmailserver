Thanks for the fixes Lawrence.  We need to start figuring out how to use
bugzilla to track bugs.

Will get them in soon.

Hi Dave

Here's the patch submission.

Description:

This patch updates XmlBeans to fix CR120759 and CR122401. CR120759 was a bug
where elements or attributes which were defined in one schema by using a ref
attribute referencing another schema and the types of the referenced element
or attribute were anonymous and the second schema was compiled in a
different schema type system. In this case when the schema was compiled, the
XSB file generated for that element or attribute would contain a type
"_XT_null" which then caused a NullPointerException when used. CR122401
removes a length limitation on serialized XmlObjects. Previously the code
used writeUTF() which has a limitation of 65535 bytes. Now we use
writeObject() which does not have this limitation. Care has been taken to
ensure that serialized objects written using the previous version of the
code can still be read.

The patch file is attached.

Cheers,

Lawrence
