Thanks a lot Eric, I'll start down this path and no doubt be back with more
questions.  Much appreciated.

cheers

Substituting namespaces is not appropriate in this case.  What it seems you
are looking for is a semantic XML comparison, not a syntactic one.  This
can be done with the cursor.  Here is how I would proceed: Walk two cursors
through the documents you are wanting to compare and,

    - Ignore namespace decls, they are syntactic
    - Accumulate attrs for containers (elements, the top level
      document) sorting them and then comparing them (i.e.
      ignore attr order)
    - Compare the QNames of elements and attributes for equality
      (prefixes are syntactic)
    - Ignore comments and PI's

You may also want to trim white space from text tokens you encounter to
deal with different formatting.  If you need, you can compare leaf values
schematically by calling getObject on leaf elements and attributes and
compare those.  However, this does not provide for true schematic
comparison (elements in various orders, etc).

There are probably other techniques you can use, but this should put you in
the right direction.

Thanks Rob,

I had tried that path, but wasn't confident in it - perhaps with those
options a revisit would be apprpriate.

thanks

With careful use of :

         xmlOptions.setLoadSubstituteNamespaces(namespaceMap);
and
         xmlOptions.setSaveImplicitNamespaces(namespaceMap);

I was able to find a tempory workaround for the very problems you mention.
This may or may not work in your case, but it worked in ours.

For "deep" compares, we simply marshal back to a string and do a string
compare.
It's NOT an ideal solution and you end up with some odd looking xml when
you
marshal non-document nodes, but it works.
