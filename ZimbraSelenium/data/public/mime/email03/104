With careful use of :

         xmlOptions.setLoadSubstituteNamespaces(namespaceMap);
and
         xmlOptions.setSaveImplicitNamespaces(namespaceMap);

I was able to find a tempory workaround for the very problems you mention.
This may or may not work in your case, but it worked in ours.

For "deep" compares, we simply marshal back to a string and do a string 
compare.
It's NOT an ideal solution and you end up with some odd looking xml when you
marshal non-document nodes, but it works.
