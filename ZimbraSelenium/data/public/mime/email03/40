My comments after starting to use the code:

1. Looks like you forgot to implement some of the lookup methods in
BuiltinBindingLoader -- they are just returning null.

2. In BindingFile it feels like the maps from xmlname -> javaname should
contain the BindingType as the value, not the javaname (and vice
versa).  Otherwise there is an object creation for every lookup, which
seems bad.

3. It seems like BindingFile and BuiltinBindingLoader might share some
common code (or should), so perhaps they should inherit from a common
base class since most of the map operations are the same between the
two.

4. Personally, I think that users of these classes should not be aware
that xmlbeans is living underneath.  Yet I find that to create a
BindingLoader from a xml binding file I need to instantiate the xml
bean.  Ideally I would like to be able to hand some factory a Collection
of File objects and get back a BindingLoader, but I guess I can write
that myself.
