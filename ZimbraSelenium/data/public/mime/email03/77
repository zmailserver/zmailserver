Eric,

Firstly, thanks for your response.  I did try walking the trees with
cursor, but found that equivalent trees with different namspace
declarations generated different tokens, understandably... I'm not sure
that is clear, what I mean is:

<foo xmlns="http://foo" />

is different to

<foo:foo xmlns:foo="http://foo" />

in terms of the cursor walk.... but I want them to be the equal.

Any advice on getting past that would be appreciated, I had trouble trying
to see how to easily get past this in XmlCursor.... probably my lack of sax
parsing isn't helping (o:

cheers

This a known limitation.  We have not yet implemented any type of deep
compare.  You can compare leaf values.  If you want to compare two trees
sans schema, it is not too difficult to walk both trees with XmlCursor
comparing tokens.  I can provide assistance with this if it meets your
needs.

Subject: deep equals implementation?


Hey all,

I'm trying to find a deep equals implementation.  I have two XmlObjects,
and equals() isn't comparing the child nodes.  I'm running off the version
1.0 released by BEA, and am currently checking out the apache src, which I
assume is largely unchanged.

On my copy, the com.bea.xbean.values.XmlComplexContentImpl.equal_to() seems
to be the method I'm after.... but its not imlpemented - well, not beyond
basic checking the schema type.   My cvs checkout is taking forever (I
imagine due to our network), can someone tell me if this is a known issue,
or provide some advice?

What I'm actually trying to do is write a unit test for something that
returns an XmlObject.  Any other suggestions would be welcome.

cheers
