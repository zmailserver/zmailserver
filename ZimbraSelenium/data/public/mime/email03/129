Shmuel,

I'll tell you what we're doing in this area, in the hope that it will be
useful.  Firstly, XMLBeans is (from my use) very accomodating of "unknowns"
- if you give it well formed XML, it will do its best to parse it into an
XMLObject, normally very successfully.  Only if you explicitly call the
validate() method will any validation occur (some experts correct me if I
am wrong here).  When it comes to schema versions, I'll address two
different scenarios.

When making backward compatible changes, with no change to the schema
namespace, we simply regenerate the XMLBeans classes, to include the new
schema elements/attributes.  When receiving messages that do not include
the additional elements/attributes, XMLBeans reports them as null when
calling the relevant getFoo() methods...  as expected.  In this way, what
the application does to deal with older versions of the schema is an
application issue.

When making non-backward compatible changes, we change the schema namespace
(we use a url/date combination namespace) and generate a new set of
XMLBeans classes, which are in a separate package to the older version
because of the namespace change.  In our environment we have the luxury of
routing at an earlier step meaning that our servlets know exactly which
version they are getting, and dont need to switch based on namespace.
However, a call to XmlObject.parse(request.getInputStream()) will return a
typed XmlObject representing the schema of the document.  This of course
assumes that the schema has been compiled, and previous loaded into the
XmlBeans type system.

I hope this is useful - we've found XmlBeans to be very easy to use in this
regard.

cheers

Subject:    Versioning of XML Schema

Assume we have a XML standard (SOAP based) version 1 schema, with its
XMLBeans generated Java types.
Then comes version 2 of same standard, another schema - meaning another
XMLBean generation cycle, another set of generated Java types.

How do I write ONCE a  product/application to support both Schema Versions,
and utilize XML schema (inevitable variations) to XMLBeans-generate Java
types ?

My basic approach is that somehow this can be done, since each instance
identifies Schema version -
so when Schema version 2 is announced, I can split program into two paths
everywhere each Java type has two versions..
But thats not in line with incremental nature of new versions.

Yet there may be more in XMLBeans to support this concern, please
share/comment,

Shmuel Koller, BMC
