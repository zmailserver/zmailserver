I will take a shot at answering this from my perspective.  XMLBeans was ori=
ginally developed at BEA and the version that was originally brought into A=
pache was shipped as a part of the Weblogic 8.1 platform products.  So XMLB=
eans v1 has been through a rigorous testing cycle and is being used in prod=
uction in significant applications now (including many of the Weblogic prod=
ucts).  Since submission to Apache there has been enhancements and bug fixe=
s.  These have only served to further stabilize and improve XMLBeans.  For =
example substitution groups and redefines were pretty much the only XML Sch=
ema features that were not supported in the BEA version but are now support=
ed in the Apache version of XMLBeans.  BEA has been doing it's own rigorous=
 testing of the latest bits and will catch up to the latest Apache version =
later this year in it's service pack 2 of the Weblogic platform.  So, in my=
 opinion, from what I have seen from users and from the testing XMLBeans v1=
 is stable and reliable. =20

The incubation status is mostly related to the progress XMLBeans is making =
in terms of establishing a community and integrating the Apache processes. =
 It is not intended to be a reflection of the stability/maturity (or lack o=
f maturity) of the technology.  That being said, as you will see in disclai=
mer text, Apache is not endorsing or standing behind any XMLBeans (or other=
 incubating project) distribution until it is out of incubation.  It is sti=
ll possible that XMLBeans would not make it out of incubation to full Apach=
e project/subproject status.  Most of the current committers are very activ=
e right now (albeit on v2 which i will elaborate on) and represent the orig=
inal team of XMLBeans developers as well as other developers such as Patric=
k Calahan to help with some of the new use cases that we want to address in=
 v2.  We believe XMLBeans has a very important future in java/xml binding a=
nd that users should have to learn only one java/xml programming model that=
 would work across most if not all of the xml programming uses cases.

As I said above XMLBeans v1 is pretty stable, meets it primary use case (in=
 memory, non-lossy, 100% schema compliant, fast, etc.) extremely well.  It =
seemed appropriate to keep that stable as we look to expand the use cases f=
or XMLBeans (with the intent of keeping full backwards api compat with XMLB=
eans 1).  So we have started on XMLBeans v2 in Apache. XMLBeans v2 will hav=
e all of the functionality of v1 (plus some enhancements) but will also sup=
port key uses cases that will make it viable for other important java/xml b=
inding use cases.  A wiki page on the XMLBeans v2 feature plan is here (htt=
p://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?XmlBeansFeaturePlan).  Key use ca=
ses include jsr101/109 binding, DOM and maybe SAAJ support, possibly JAXB 1=
.0 support, and java to schema type scenarios.  Web services uses cases as =
well as some other interesing use cases tend to not emphasize the non-lossy=
 nature of XMLBeans 1.0 style binding so we would like to provide users the=
 ability to compile schema/java for java/xml binding and choose their usage=
 options as late as possible.  Some options would have to be chosen at buil=
d time and would affect programming model significantly other options could=
 be chosen at runtime (probably when loading the xml instance).  For exampl=
e it might be cool if the user could compile schema/wsdl for use in web ser=
vices scenario and perhaps by default have it be lossy (i.e., throw the xml=
 away), read only which could be very fast but perhaps in another scenario =
use the same generated xmlbeans jar in a non-lossy, read-write scenario (an=
 underlying xml store would be created).=20

We are just getting started with v2 and you will begin to see more posts on=
 the dev list and user list about it.  The code is building and passing bas=
ic tests but I don't think there is anything runnable yet except the curren=
t xmlbeans 1 type functionality.  We continue to run the XMLBeans 1.0 tests=
 on all commits in order to assure backwards compat.=20

XMLBeans 2 has no official target date and I expect development on it will =
go on for awhile (a year or so?).  As a user I think you should be able to =
be comfortable that XMLBeans v1 is currently stable and pretty mature and w=
ill be supported into XMLBeasn v2 (although not officially sanctioned by Ap=
ache).

wordy post here, hope it helps.
