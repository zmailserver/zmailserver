As expected, our department will be growing by at least 2 more people during the next month.  We plan to complete the hiring process for both people by next week, and have those people join us shortly thereafter.  This should make everyone's schedules a bit more reasonable -- less overtime!! 
  
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
  
Thank you,
Courtney
