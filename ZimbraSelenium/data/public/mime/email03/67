realistically, i don't have the time right now. it's very likely that 
jakarta  matters are going to have to take up a lot (or more likely 
most) of my time in the near future.

i can now run java 1.4 on my main development machine and i have plans 
to take a better look at the xml-beans source but until i can set aside 
the time i need, i'm going to have to heckle from the sidelines...

so if there's anyone who's just dying to for an easy way to start 
contributing and fancy's a crack at this, now's a good time to jump 
in...
