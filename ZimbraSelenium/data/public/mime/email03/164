Dear all, 
  
I am very pleased to announce that we have been awarded the Gold Star of Excellence by the Service Rating Institute (SRI), for the 3rd year in a row!  This is the highest honor to receive in our industry, and it is a testimony to the hard work, conscientiousness and customer-focus that each of you brings with you each day. 
  
Later this week there will be an announcement of a company-wide ceremony where we will receive this award from SRI.  We look forward to seeing you at the ceremony.  
  
Thank you again for all of your dedication to our customers! 
  
Samuel Darmo
CEO
