I see.  Right, good point.

I think you should be careful not to make the same mistakes that the
JDK<br>
made early on with the map implementations.&nbsp; The early map
implementations<br>
were thread safe and very slow, so no-one used them.&nbsp; It might be
best to<br>
have two implementations of the store (one that is thread safe &amp; one
that<br>
isn't) so that users can choose safety over performance.&nbsp; Or
performance if<br>
they know the data will only be read in a single thread as may be the
case<br>
in WS-invocations...<br><br>

&gt; Eric, was thinking about the threading/object creation etc<br>
&gt; issues over the<br>
&gt; weekend.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Another interesting issue: currently we use a finalizer on<br>
&gt; cursors, but<br>
&gt; finalizers seem to be fairly expensive, so apps that spew out<br>
&gt; lots and lots<br>
&gt; of cursors have issues.&nbsp; I wonder what problems we'd have
to<br>
&gt; deal with in<br>
&gt; order to eliminate the finalizer, and whether or not that<br>
&gt; would be possible,<br>
&gt; or if it would come into conflict with some of the other<br>
&gt; parameters of the<br>
&gt; problem just like synchronization?<br>
