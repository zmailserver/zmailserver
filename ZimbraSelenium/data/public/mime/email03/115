There are several W3C XML Schema validation tools available and I am sure o=
thers on the list would have suggestions.  I will go with the mainstay that=
 you will probably hear about:

Sun's free multi-schema validation (Java-based) tool:
http://wwws.sun.com/software/xml/developers/multischema/

I use the one above and it works very well though is command-line oriented.

XMLSpy from Altova: Excellent GUI product - runs on Windows only.  Relative=
ly inexpensive but not free.
http://www.xmlspy.com/

TurboXML package from TIBCO: Very good GUI product - all Java based (runs o=
n any platform) with rich XML repository and project management capabilitie=
s.  More expensive than XMLSpy but more powerful and useful in a software s=
hop that is developing lots of schemas every day.

Hope this helps.

	Is there a good schema validation tool I could use to confirm that
my schema is valid?  I thought it was, but I'm fairly new to schemas, and
I guess I should prove that before claiming it's an XMLBeans issue.  :)
