The German women's national football team (German: Deutsche Fuﬂballnationalmannschaft der Frauen) represents 
Germany in international women's football and is directed by the German Football Association (DFB). The 
team ñ then informally called West Germany in English ñ played its first international match in 1982. After 
German reunification in 1990, the DFB squad remained the national side of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The German national team is one of the most successful in women's football. They are two-time world 
champions, having won the 2003 and 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. Germany is the only nation to have
won both the men's and the women's World Cup. The team has won seven of the ten UEFA European Championships, 
claiming the last five titles in a row. Germany has won three bronze medals at the Women's Olympic Football 
Tournament, finishing third in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Birgit Prinz holds the record for most appearances 
and is the team's all-time leading goalscorer. Prinz has also set international records; she has received 
the FIFA World Player of the Year award three times and is the joint overall top goalscorer at the Women's 
World Cup.
