This documentation is in reference to bug 75630 (http://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75630).

With IE 10, Microsoft dropped support for DX filters. Zimbra used the DX filters to allow users to customize the color
of icons (e.g. tags, folders, calendars, etc).  For browsers other than IE, Zimbra uses the Canvas tag for this 
customization. However, as of Zimbra 8, the AJAx application is rendered using quirks mode which prevents the AJAX
client for using Canvas or SVG to manipulate the color of the icons.  

The approach to support IE 10 in Zimbra 8 is to generate all combinations of the icons which can be customized.  There
are 15 icons with 59 possible color variations.  To generate these icons, we have a HTML web page which uses the same
canvas methods in the non-IE browsers to generate the icons.  The data-uri that is generated is then POSTed to a PHP page
and saved to a file.

Once you have these 886 files, you can place them ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/img/ie-custom-icons.

Next, run ant clean deploy.

This will generate a ie-custom-icons.png sprite image and also add the required CSS classes to images.css.

Copy the ie-custom-icons.png into the /img/ie-custom-icons directory and remove the previously generated icons.
Copy the CSS classes from images.css that reference ie-custom-icons.png into a CSS file ie-custom-icons.css.

We conditionally load the ie-custom-icons.css stylesheet for IE9 user agents (in Zimbra 8 we force IE10 into IE9 browser
mode so detection is done as IE9).

####PHP Script#####
Mac OS ships with an Apache webserver and PHP installed.  You just need to enable it.
* Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf so the PHP module is loaded:
LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

* Restart the web server
sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart

* Save the following as /Librar/WebServer/Documents/processing.php
<?
$data = substr($_POST['imageData'], strpos($_POST['imageData'], ",") + 1);
$imageName = $_POST['imageName'];
$decodedData = base64_decode($data);
file_put_contents("/tmp/custom/".$imageName.".png", $decodedData);
?>
 
* Give /tmp/custom/ directory the required permissions
chown _www /tmp/custom
chmod 755 /tmp/custom

#####JavaScript######
* Copy ImageGenerator.html to the public directory of Zimbra so it can be accessed via
http://localhost:7070/public/ImageGenerator.html

This script has only been tested with Chrome on Mac.  

Once you access that URL the /tmp/custom directory populate with the images.
