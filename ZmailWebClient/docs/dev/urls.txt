ABOUT

Many URLs to the Zmail web application are handled by filters and
servlets to provide customizations, etc. This section lists some of
these mappings and their purpose.

NOTE: This list may not be complete or current. Refer to the web.xml
      file for the current filter and servlet mappings.


SERVICE WEB APPLICATION - http://{host}/service/*

/zimlet/res/*

	Aggregates zimlet resources based on the allowed set of zimlets
	for the user's COS. The output is cached to disk; a debug=1
	request parameter can be used to prevent the servlet using the
	cached output.

	SEE: org.zmail.cs.zimlet.ZimletResources
	SEE: /opt/zmail/jetty/work/resource-cache/zimletres/

NOTE: There are a lot more URL mappings in the service web application
      but they are not of general use for the user client.


WEB CLIENT WEB APPLICATION - http://{host}/zmail/*

*.jsp

	The standard Jasper servlet is extended to allow a custom
	class loader to be used for requests. This transparently
	merges skin message files into the default ones allowing
	skins to independently override messages. The JSP pages
	continue to use the same mechanisms to load and format
	messages in JSP pages without having to care about how the
	skin messages are overloaded.

	SEE: org.zmail.webClient.servlet.JspServlet

/adminhelp/*
/bhelp/*
/help/*

	Redirects user to help files for their preferred locale, if
	the file exists for that locale. If the requested file does
	not exist in the requested locale, the default help file is
	returned (i.e. en_US).

	SEE: org.zmail.webClient.filters.RedirectHelp

/js/ajax/util/AjxTimezoneData.js

	Returns generated timezone data in JavaScript form.

	SEE: org.zmail.webClient.filters.TimezoneFilter
	SEE: /opt/zmail/conf/timezones.ics

/css/*
/html/*
/js/skin.js

	Aggregates skin resources specified in the requested skin's
	manifest file. The output is cached to disk; a debug=1 request
	parameter can be used to prevent the servlet using the cached
	output.

	NOTE: The CSS resources can be a combination of skin CSS files
	      and files in the css/ directory.

	SEE: org.zmail.webClient.servlet.SkinResources
	SEE: /skins/{skin}/manifest.xml
	SEE: /opt/zmail/jetty/work/resource-cache/skinres/
	SEE: /css/*

/keys/*
/messages/*
/res/*

	Aggregates messages and key bindings into a single file for
	performance. The output is cached to memory; a debug=1 request
	parameter can be used to prevent the servlet using the cached
	output.
