ABOUT

Throughout this document, the source repository directory path is
written as /depot/{branch}/. The primary (or "head" or "trunk") branch
is "main" and the 5.0.x branch is "FRANKLIN". This document is written
according to the main branch but the same information applies to the
FRANKLIN branch.


SOURCE TREE STRUCTURE

The source is organized in the repository as a series of modules (e.g.
ZmailServer, ZmailWebClient, etc). There are many source modules but
not all of the modules are of interest to the user interface developer.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailServer/

	Server code and SOAP command documentation.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailTagLib/

	JSP tag libraries used primarily for the standard (HTML) client.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/

	Web client code for advanced (AJAX), standard (HTML), and mobile
	(lite HTML such as iPhone) clients.

	This module contains the HTML/JSP pages, JSP tags, CSS styles,
	JavaScript source, images, messages & key bindings, and customization
	(i.e. skin and portal) files.

	SEE: zmail.txt

//depot/{branch}/Zimlet/

	Public zimlet source.


ZIMBRA SERVER - //depot/{branch}/ZmailServer/

There are only a few files in this module of interest to the client code.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailServer/conf/web.xml*

	The web.xml file is used for development and web.xml.production is
	used for deployment.

	NOTE: ZmailWebClient uses a single web.xml for both purposes.

	SEE: org.zmail.cs.zimlet.ZimletResources

//depot/{branch}/ZmailServer/conf/msgs/ZsMsg*.properties

	Translations for server generated messages including calendar mail
	message content for resources; server errors; etc.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailServer/docs/soap*.txt

	Describes the server SOAP commands.

	NOTE: There is no WSDL definition for the SOAP commands.

org.zmail.cs.zimlet.ZimletResources

	Aggregates zimlet resources into a single file for performance.

	SEE: <servlet> and <servlet-mapping> entries in web.xml* files


JSP TAG LIBRARY - //depot/{branch}/ZmailTagLib/

The JSP tag library is used primarily for the standard and mobile
clients but is also used by the advanced client for login, etc. This
module defines beans for server objects and contains utility tags
and functions.

NOTE: No user interface elements are created with code from this
      module.


ZIMBRA WEB CLIENT - //depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/

The majority of the source code for the user interface is located
here. This module is divided into Java source code required during
the build or deployed as servlets to the web container; and all
of the files that are deployed as part of the web application.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/src/       - Java tools and servlets
//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/   - everything else

NOTE: This document does not describe *all* of the contents of the
      module -- just the important ones.


Java Code

This module contains Java source code for tools used during the
build and servlets used as part of the web application. Some of
the important packages are:

org.zmail.kabuki.servlets

	Contains base class of servlet used to convert messages and
	key bindings from Java .properties files to native JavaScript
	objects for use in the client.

	SEE: org.zmail.webClient.servlet.Props2JsServlet
	SEE: <servlet> and <servlet-mapping> entries in web.xml file

org.zmail.kabuki.tools

	Build tools for generating data including merging images into
	icon maps; compiling user interface templates; and generating
	timezone information.

	SEE: //depot/{branch}/ZmailServer/conf/timezones.ics
	SEE: org.zmail.webClient.filters.TimezoneFilter

org.zmail.webClient.build

	Build tools to aggregate JavaScript source files into package
	files for run-time performance.

org.zmail.webClient.filters

	Web container filters for various tasks including redirecting
	user to localized versions of help files; generating timezone
	information for advanced client; and wrapping JSP requests to
	include skin message and key binding overrides.

	SEE: org.zmail.kabuki.tools.tz.GenerateData
	SEE: <filter> and <filter-mapping> entries in web.xml file


Web App Code

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/js/ajax/

	Ajax toolkit source code. All classes here are prefixed with
	"Ajx" (Ajax) or "Dwt" (DHTML widget toolkit). The DWT framework
	implements the user interface controls used in the user and admin
	clients.

	NOTE: The admin console extensively uses the XForms framework
	      contained in DWT.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/js/zmail/

	Code shared between the user and admin clients. All classes
	here are prefixed "Z" (Zmail).

	NOTE: There are exceptions to the naming rule. The reason is
	      historical but the names are left as-is for backward
	      compatibility.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/js/zmailAdmin/

	Admin console source code. The classes here are prefixed with "Za"
	(Zmail Admin).

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/js/zmailMail/

	User client source code. The classes here are prefixed with "Zm"
	(Zmail Mail).


User Client Code

The user client code is found under WebRoot/js/zmailMail/ and
contains all of the classes needed for the web app.

SEE: zmail.txt


Web App JSP Pages and Tags

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/h/
//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/m/

	Standard and mobile client source code.

	SEE: //depot/{branch}/ZmailTagLib/
	SEE: //depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/WEB-INF/tags/*
	SEE: //depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/WEB-INF/tlds/*
	SEE: <jsp-property-group> entries in web.xml file

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/public/

	HTML and JSP pages used by the clients. These include the
	login page, the admin and user client launch pages, and
	other supporting pages.

	SEE: login.jsp
	SEE: launchZWC.jsp

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/WEB-INF/tags/
//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/WEB-INF/tlds/

	Tag libraries used by the standard and mobile clients.

	SEE: //depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/h/*
	SEE: //depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/m/*


Web App Files

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/img/

	Application images. This directory contains all of the
	images used as icons as well as default logos and other
	images that are not combined into icon maps.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/messages/
//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/keys/

	Messages and key bindings as Java .properties files. Skins
	can override or add these messages by creating a file with
	the same name in the /skins/{skin}/messages/ or keys/
	directories. If the skin overrides messages and/or key
	bindings, only the *different* messages need to be
	specified (i.e. NOT all of the original messages unless they
	are all changed).

	SEE: org.zmail.webClient.servlet.Props2JsServlet

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/skins/
//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/admin_skins/

	Customization files. While similar, the admin console and the
	user client do not share the same skin source files.

	SEE: /opt/zmail/bin/zmskindeploy

	NOTE: The zmskindeploy script automatically compiles any
	      templates and merges images present in the skin.

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/portals/

	Example portal pages. The portal "app" adds an application tab
	before the other app tabs. The content of the portal app is
	defined in the portal's manifest file.

	SEE: http://{host}/zmail/portals/{portal}/manifest.xml
	SEE: zmprov (mc|ma) zmailFeaturePortalEnabled TRUE
	SEE: zmprov (mc|ma) zmailPortalName {portal}
	SEE: /opt/zmail/bin/zmzimletctl

//depot/{branch}/ZmailWebClient/WebRoot/WEB-INF/web.xml

	Web app configuration file. This file is used for both the admin
	and user clients, either in development or production mode.
