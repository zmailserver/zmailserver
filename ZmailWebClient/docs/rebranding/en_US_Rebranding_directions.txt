REBRANDING ZWC HELP TOPICS - HOW TO CHANGE VARIABLES 

The Zmail Web Client Help can be rebranded to replace reference to Zmail and the Zmail product  name with your company and product names.

The default variables  in the file ZbMsg.properties are as follows:

"web client long name" - ClientNameLong = Zmail Web Client
"web client short name" - ClientNameShort = ZWC
"Your company name" - CompanyName = Zmail
"This variable is not relevant.  Do not change" - DesktopName = Zmail Desktop
"product full name" - CollaborationProductFullName = Zmail Collaboration Suite
"product short name" - CollaborationProductShortName = ZCS

To change these variables

1. SSH to the Zmail server

2. As Zmail change directory to the following directory
/opt/zmail/jetty/webapps/zmail/WEB-INF/classes/messages/

3. To change the values, edit ZbMsg.properties.  Replace the Zmail name with your company name. DO NOT CHANGE OR REMOVE THE VARIABLE DESCRIPTOR.

4. Restart the server.  Type zmcontrol restart.

5. Reload the Help in the browser. 

Step 5 may require a forced browser reload or a clearing of the browser cache.

Note: When you upgrade ZCS, changes made to the ZbMsg.properties file are lost. We recommend that you make a copy of the changed file to restore after upgrades.
