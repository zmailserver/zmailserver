/**
 * Helper class for applying snooze 'before' times to a set of appointments that
 * were handled en-masse in the reminder dialog.
 *
 * For each appointment
 *  - If the appointment has already started (whether in-progress or completed) then the
 *    before value is not applied, and we store this appt for later processing.
 *  - For appointments that have not started yet:
 *     - If the appointment startTime + snoozeTime is in the future (> now) then
 *       set the appt reminder untilTime.
 *     - If the startTime + snoozeTime is in the past (< now), loop over the
 *       standard set of 'before' snooze times and find the max before time that we can
 *       apply and still have the reminder occur in the future.
 *    Once a time for the appointment's reminder is calculated, save the minimum one (i.e. the
 *    reminder for the earlier occuring appt) as earliestUntilTime.
 *
 * Finally, loop over each of the appointments whose start time is past.
 *  - Set their snooze time to the soonestUntilTime.  When the soonest appt reminder goes off,
 *    any past appointments will appear too.  The user should dismiss them, but till then they
 *    are dragged along
 *
