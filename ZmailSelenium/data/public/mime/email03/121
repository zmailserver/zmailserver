hi david

there are some documents aimed at apache release managers which have been 
assembled on the web: 
http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?ReleaseManager.

IIRC incubating projects should not create full releases (the reason being 
that the ASF makes a long term commitment to maintain all full releases) 
until the incubation process is finished (but this policy is something 
that should probably be checked with the incubator pmc). instead, unstable 
(milestone, alpha, beta, gold etc) releases should be created. these 
should be made available for download from the appropriate subdirectory of 
cvs.apache.org. (again, probably the pmc are the right people to ask about 
policy on whether they should be made available from an xml subdirectory 
download or a incubator download subdirectory.)

if you're considering releases, then this might also be a good time to 
consider nightlies and gump (if there are not yet sorted out). gump is a 
meta-builder which re-builds and tests all jakarta projects (and many 
other apache projects) with the latest versions of each dependency each 
day. nightly builds are created every day and uploaded to cvs.apache.org. 
i would recommend that xml beans signs up for both.
