Yes.  By default, you use the thread's context typeloader, which by default
uses the context classloader to load types only from the JARs on your
classpath.

Instead, you'll want to use your own schematypeloader and create instances
from that.  You'll want to:

1. build a schematypeloader that includes your schematypesystem.  (e.g., use
XmlBeans.typeLoaderUnion to put it together with iether the builtin or
context typeloader, or use loadXsd instead of copmileXsd, which does that
for you).  You just need to make sure your schematypeloader is
self-consistent, i.e., it has all the builtin types etc.

2. use the .parse(..) methods that appear on SchemaTypeLoader instead of the
*.Factory.parse methods.  The only difference is that the *.Factory.parse
methods use the context typeloader all the time, which loads schema types
only off of the JARs on your classpath.

That's it!
