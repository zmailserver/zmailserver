Hey Cliff,

Oh, I was going to check in the RI jar as a library not in src form, this
would allow us to get to work on the binding runtime.  I would imagine at
somepoint we would port the internal parser to implement 173 or build a
walker over the splay tree.

FYI the jar is publicly available at http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173
