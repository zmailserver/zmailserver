Storing namepairs rather than xmlnames or javanames to avoid the object
creation.  Perhaps NamePair should be made public (BindingTypeName)?

Factoring as suggested.

Will add factory methods that opeate on files/streams.

Hopefully we'll be able to bootstrap using our new-improved-v2 binding
and make it go away. (Of course that will require refactoring callers of the
BTS
api, but we were able to do it in v1...) In the meantime, I'm not sure if
there is
a better approach to take instead?  Any ideas?  This is hand-done data
binding
lite.

Adding getArrayItemType(int depth)

Yah, probably should, not changing at the moment.

I've been thinking that there may be problems that we need to solve that
require us to make the Java name longer than just a regular class name,
e.g.,
"java.lang.Object{JAXRPC1}" versus "java.langObject{JAXRPC2}", so
that's why I've called it just the vague "String".

(The idea of the above is that different standards may require us to be able
to apply different rules for the same pair of schema type and Java class,
and
we may need a way to differentiate.  In the situations I can see so far, the
most natural way to differentiate would be to add a special "extra tag" onto
the thing we use to identify the Java class.)

Because of the way we named the APIs and the schema types, there are
a bunch of name collisions.  Also, it's just sort of a way of making it
clear
when we're dealing with a physical vs logical object.  If we can think of
better
(different) names for either the schema types or the BTS, I'm happy to
change
them around.  I'm not really happy with our names (but then when can you
ever really be happy with a name)?

Yes, adding...
