Hmmm,

Just on a  lark, I wondered if maybe my long file path to the code tree=20
might be a problem, so I moved the code tree to the root directory of my=20
drive and re-tried the build. Lo and Behold, the build worked just=20
fine.  So then I dragged the exactsame directory back to its original=20
location and retried the build. It failed with the same error as before.=20
So I'm not sure why, but  my problem seemed to be related to the=20
location of the tree. Possibly it's due to the very long path, possible=20
it's due to spaces in the path?

Anyway, past my build problem. Woo Hoo!
