Substituting namespaces is not appropriate in this case.  What it seems you=
 are looking for is a semantic XML comparison, not a syntactic one.  This c=
an be done with the cursor.  Here is how I would proceed: Walk two cursors =
through the documents you are wanting to compare and,

    - Ignore namespace decls, they are syntactic
    - Accumulate attrs for containers (elements, the top level
      document) sorting them and then comparing them (i.e.
      ignore attr order)
    - Compare the QNames of elements and attributes for equality
      (prefixes are syntactic)
    - Ignore comments and PI's

You may also want to trim white space from text tokens you encounter to dea=
l with different formatting.  If you need, you can compare leaf values sche=
matically by calling getObject on leaf elements and attributes and compare =
those.  However, this does not provide for true schematic comparison (eleme=
nts in various orders, etc).

There are probably other techniques you can use, but this should put you in=
 the right direction.

Thanks Rob,

I had tried that path, but wasn't confident in it - perhaps with those
options a revisit would be apprpriate.

thanks

With careful use of :

         xmlOptions.setLoadSubstituteNamespaces(namespaceMap);
and
         xmlOptions.setSaveImplicitNamespaces(namespaceMap);

I was able to find a tempory workaround for the very problems you mention.
This may or may not work in your case, but it worked in ours.

For "deep" compares, we simply marshal back to a string and do a string
compare.
It's NOT an ideal solution and you end up with some odd looking xml when
you
marshal non-document nodes, but it works.
