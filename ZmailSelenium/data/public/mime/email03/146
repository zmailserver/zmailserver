Are you doing document style or RPC style?

We're using XMLBeans for document style web services, which then simply
becomes a case of writing a servlet with the opening lines of the doPost
method looking something like:

public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response)
  throws IOException, ServletException
{
  OurSchemaTypeDocument doc =
OurSchemaTypeDocument.Factory.parse(request.getInputStream());
  // process the document

so from that point of view, it is _very_ easy to use.

I imagine that if you're talking rpc, then it would be significantly
harder, and you may be better off using an existing framework.

Subject:    XML to Java at run-time

I am looking at Java Binding tool for developing WebServices - incoming as
SOAP/XML
to be translated at runtime to  loading/calling of pre-written
classes/handlers.
In other words, I am looking for so called mapped binding (mapping only at
run time, without code pre-generation).

In a sense - that will be like loading classes/calling instances - driven
by
XML instance acting as a flow control.

The input XML is 100% schema based, I understand XMLBeans uses xsd as well
at run time -
the basic question is what can be done wit XML instance without
pre-generation of XMLObject classes.

Quick and Castor are said to support mapped binding to "your code".
Can anyone discuss/point how much XMLBeans plays in this arena ?
