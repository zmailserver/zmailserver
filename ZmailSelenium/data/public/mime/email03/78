Just doing the parse/print methods for now seems fine to me; let's not
worry about cleaning up the validation methods yet.

When we work out the v2 SOM we can revisit the validation issue, and
rationalize all those methods then. However, hopefully build dependencies
shouldn't block this code from going into a common place.  If you're getting
stuck by references to the impl class XmlObjectBase just to call things
like getting the intValue() of facet constraints, for example, you should be
able to cast to the public interface org.apache.xmlbeans.SimpleValue
instead.
