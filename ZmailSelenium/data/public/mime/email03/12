Hi Sam,

While you were out of town a few urgent PO's accumulated that you need to
approve ASAP! Here are the PO numbers so that you don't have to go through
all the reqs in your queue: GR9328B2-3X499, GR9328X2-3Y847, and
GR738B64-8774Q. That last one has a due date of Aug 9, 2004.

Also Vanessa (vanessa@livespace.com) wants you to get in touch with her as soon as you 
can. Apparently there is an issue with the space planning for the new office space
and she needs you to answer some questions for her.

Brad over in telecom asked me to have you read information at
the following website http://www.avaya.com/ac/common/index.jhtml?location=M1H1005G1002F2013P3041N4283 
He said he emailed it to you several times, but has not heard back from you. I told him
that you have been on the road and are probably way behind with Email. He needs you to
understand this product since he needs a buy decision no later than April 16. Here is a snippet of his
email to me:

> Could you please have Sam read the infomation at http://www.avaya.com/ac/common/index.jhtml?location=M1H1005G1002F2013P3041N4283
> ASAP. It is imperative that he be familiar with this material as he will have to make
> an important purchasing decision based on it. I have tried emailing him several times
> over the past few days, but have had no luck in reaching him. If he has any questions
> He can reach me on my personal cell: 408 986 5898

Let me know if I can help you with anything!

Thanks!

Cindy
