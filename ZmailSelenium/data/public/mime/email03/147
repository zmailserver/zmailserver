Srini,

xmlbeans v1 was developed under BEA's umbrella and was 
released to the public.

BEA and the xmlbeans developers then decided it belonged in the 
open source community and the code moved to the Apache
Foundation.

The foundation has a policy that the community around a codebase
is more important than the code itself. The community must
prove that it is open, dynamic and responsive; it must also
show that it has staying power, that it will not implode and
disappear. The proving ground is called incubation.

So the community surrounding the code is in the incubator,
where it will remain until The Apache Foundation's is satisfied
that there is a viable support and development community 
that will stand the test of time.

Work has begun on a new version of xmlbeans as outlined in 
http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?XmlBeansFeaturePlan

As the foundation members have repeatedly told the xmlbeans
committers, incubation is about community, not about code quality.
We believe the quality is there and we are demonstrating that
the community is viable.

I think you will quickly be convinced that there is an
active and responsive group of people supporting both
v1 and v2 of xmlbeans.

  Ken.

Hi,

I am really impressed after reading up quite a bit on xmlbeans. I am at 
the threshold of using it at my work in a project. But the thing that is 
holding me below this threshold is the fact that it is in incubation. 
What does it mean precisely to be in incubation and does it mean that 
xmlbeans cannot be used in a production environment? I did search quite 
a bit looking for comparisons and other articles but in vain.

Another question I have is you have two different trees in CVS (V1 & 
V2). Does it mean that you are already working on version 2? I am a bit 
confused.

Thanks,
Srini.
