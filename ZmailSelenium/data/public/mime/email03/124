This could be simple. Announce at announce@apache.org and
announce(ments)@(xml|ws|jakarta).apache.org
about the release and put the *note*
"We are now under incubation .. http://incubator.apache.org" ...
That's all.
(I am willing to put the news at jakarta.apache.org top page)

In such an announcement, please note that the you should tell people the
existence of "xmlbeans-user@xml.apache.org" mailing list
for building the powerful users' community.

--

Without users' community and release build, why can you build
"healthy" community and solicit other independent committers?
Incubator folks seem to lack these kind of vision. Chichen an' Egg ...
That's all. :-)

Anyway, foundation-wide announcement would be necessary (needless to say,
please put the 3-5 lines blurb of xmlbeans) for xmlbeans project
to grow up more. This would encourage and hurry up the "escape from
incubator project" from my point of view:
http://www.apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html#foundation-announce

Thank you.
