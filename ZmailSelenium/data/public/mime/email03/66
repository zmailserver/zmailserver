Robert,  I understand the concern here, but if there is a version that 
has been finished / super tested, etc, it seems a little sily not to 
make it stable.  If incubation were to fail, and xmlbeans ended up on, 
say, Java.net, it's not going to change the quality of the code one way 
or another.   I sort of thought that we already went through this with 
the lists being @xml or @incubator
