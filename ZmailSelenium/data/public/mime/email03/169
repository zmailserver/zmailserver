Chris-

We had a great meeting with MySQL at LinuxWorld.  You can read more 
about their new offer at http://www.mysql.com/products/database/cluster/.  
They want to meet with us in Seattle to talk about how we can improve
the performance of our product even more by leveraging their new 
release.  Additionally, they want us to bring the performance test
server that you ordered.

Can you meet with them next Friday?  If not, I am free on Sept 26th.

They want to meet at their office:
2510 Fairview Ave Seattle WA 98102

We are going to be meeting with Bob Thomas and Jill Marks.  In you have 
any questions they recommended that you send Jill a note at 
jill.marks@mysql.com.

Additionally, Ari placed the order for the test server.  You need to approve
the PO - GR733454-8788Q and you can track the server with the FedEx tracking
number 792806493888.

Call me and let me know what works for you?

-jr
