Unfortunately, W3C XML Schema doesn't quite treat "extensions" and "restric=
tions" like you would think in a programming language.  When extending a sc=
hema from another, you actually have to redefine all of the elements (this =
part stinks).  I believe that the problem you may be having (would need to =
see your XSD files) is that you have defined an element as mandatory in the=
 base schema and in the extended schema you therefore must include it (even=
 though you meant to override it).

I don't think this is so much of an XMLBeans issue as a general schema issu=
e.  I recommend resolution of the schema-compliance issue before trying to =
work with XMLBeans (which needs a valid schema before it can do its work in=
 this context).  Roger Costello does an excellent treatment of W3C XML Sche=
ma and has examples in his tutorials on extending and restricting schema el=
ements at http://www.xfront.com.  Hope this helps.

	I wonder if I can construct something like this in a schema and
get XMLBeans to generate corresponding Java classes:

element "engine"
element "car" contains an "engine"
element "ford-engine" is an extension of "engine"
element "ford" is an restriction of "car" where the "engine" child element=20
  must be an instance of "ford-engine"
the "ford*" elements are in a different namespace than the others

so this would be legitimate:

<a:car>
  <a:engine>
</a:car>

and this would be legitimate:

<b:ford>
  <b:ford-engine>
</b:ford>

but this would not:

<b:ford>
  <a:engine>
</b:ford>

	I'm not sure exactly how the "Ford" would be generated into a
JavaBean.  It would extend the "Car" bean.  Perhaps it would override the
"setEngine" method from "Car", but then have an assertion inside that that
"Engine" you passed in was really an "instanceof FordEngine".

	I've tried to construct this in XSD, but I'm stymied by the part
where "ford" restricts "car" to limit the type of engine passed in -- I
keep getting the following message, and it doesn't really give me enough
information to determine whether my syntax is wrong or the whole idea is
wrong or what.  Is this really supposed to be possible?

Thanks,
	Aaron
