I don't think we need to push back.  We just need to describe the=20
technical qualifications of the code separately from the organizational=20
qualifications of the code.  The version numbers and other documentation=20
can reflect the richness and stability of the code.  The "incubated"=20
prefix/suffix/whatever can indicate that the project code is not yet=20
fully endorsed by the ASF.  I also think a blurb in the README file
and on the Web site can elaborate on this distinction. =20
