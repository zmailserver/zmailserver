Chris,

As the spec lead for JSR 173/STAX, it would be great to have you=20
involved, but the process you described isn't really how things work. =20
If you've got code you'd like to contribute, you can email it to this=20
list and we can see how it would fit in with the rest of the project=20
and check it in if it makes sense.  If you're talking about an entire=20
RI, you might want to post the source somewhere for the community to=20
review. It might also be something more appropriate for another part=20
of the XML project.  We have been talking about making XMLBeans v2
work with JSR 173, but I don't know if it's appropriate for the entire
RI to be checked in to the tree (aside from the obvious questions of
licensing).

Cliff
