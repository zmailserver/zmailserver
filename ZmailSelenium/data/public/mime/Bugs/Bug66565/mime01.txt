The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le 
monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, designed 
by Frédéric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue, a gift to the United 
States from the people of France, is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the 
Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the 
law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, 
July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue has become an icon of 
freedom and of the United States.
